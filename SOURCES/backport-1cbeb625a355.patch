Subject: xen/x86: prevent addition of .note.gnu.property if livepatch is
 enabled
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

GNU assembly that supports such feature will unconditionally add a
.note.gnu.property section to object files.  The content of that section can
change depending on the generated instructions.  The current logic in
livepatch-build-tools doesn't know how to deal with such section changing
as a result of applying a patch and rebuilding.

Since .note.gnu.property is not consumed by the Xen build, suppress its
addition when livepatch support is enabled.
