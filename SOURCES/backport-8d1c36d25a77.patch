Subject: altcall: fix __alt_call_maybe_initdata so it's safe for livepatch
MIME-Version: 1.0

Setting alternative call variables as __init is not safe for use with
livepatch, as livepatches can rightfully introduce new alternative calls to
structures marked as __alt_call_maybe_initdata (possibly just indirectly due to
replacing existing functions that use those).  Attempting to resolve those
alternative calls then results in page faults as the variable that holds the
function pointer address has been freed.

When livepatch is supported use the __ro_after_init attribute instead of
__initdata for __alt_call_maybe_initdata.
