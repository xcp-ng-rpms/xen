Quiet "Broke affinity for irq" messages during suspend

Quiet the "Broke affinity for irq" messages during suspend. Do this
by conditionally printing the messages depending on the system state,
as originally suggested by Jan when discussing commit e509b8e09c00
("x86: fixup IRQs when CPUs go down during shutdown").
