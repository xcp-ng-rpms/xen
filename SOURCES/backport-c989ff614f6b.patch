Subject: x86/svm: Separate STI and VMRUN instructions in svm_asm_do_resume()

There is a corner case in the VMRUN instruction where its INTR_SHADOW state
leaks into guest state if a VMExit occurs before the VMRUN is complete.  An
example of this could be taking #NPF due to event injection.

Xen can safely execute STI anywhere between CLGI and VMRUN, as CLGI blocks
external interrupts too.  However, an exception (while fatal) will appear to
be in an irqs-on region (as GIF isn't considered), so position the STI after
the speculation actions but prior to the GPR pops.
